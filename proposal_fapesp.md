## Territorial Reconfiguration Effects of Coercive Public Security Policies

### 1. Research Problem

Open drug-use scenes represent persistent territorialized phenomena in large metropolitan areas. Coercive public security interventions — such as police operations, intensified patrols, and forced removals — are frequently implemented to suppress these scenes.

However, existing evidence remains inconclusive regarding whether such interventions produce genuine reductions or merely spatial reconfiguration of illicit markets.

This project investigates how coercive security policies reshape the spatial structure, concentration, and mobility of open drug-use scenes.

### 2. Central Research Question

Do coercive public security interventions reduce open drug-use scenes, or do they reconfigure their territorial distribution through bounded spatial displacement?

---

### 3. Theoretical Contribution

This project advances the literature by proposing the **Territorial Reconfiguration Hypothesis**:

Coercive interventions compress visible activity in treated areas but induce spatial redistribution within bounded geographic ranges rather than city-wide dispersion.

The project contributes to:

- Spatial criminology
- Public policy evaluation
- Urban economics of illicit markets
- Displacement theory

It integrates spatial inequality measures and causal identification strategies rarely combined in this literature.

---

### 4. Empirical Strategy

The project combines:

- H3 spatial aggregation (hexagonal grid)
- Difference-in-Differences with Two-Way Fixed Effects
- Event-study dynamic analysis
- Radial spillover models (distance-based treatment intensity)
- Spatial Gini coefficient and concentration metrics

The empirical design allows identification of:

- Local treatment effects
- Dynamic temporal adjustments
- Distance-decay spillovers
- Changes in territorial inequality

---

### 5. Data Strategy

The empirical implementation will rely on:

- Georeferenced police records
- Administrative enforcement data
- Municipal security reports

All public versions of the repository operate on synthetic data to preserve confidentiality and ethical standards.

### 6. Expected Contributions

Academic contributions:
- Formal modeling of territorial compression vs displacement
- Integration of spatial inequality into policy evaluation
- Evidence on bounded spillover dynamics

Policy contributions:
- Evidence-based assessment of coercive strategies
- Identification of territorial redistribution risks
- Informing integrated urban security policies

### 8. Gap in the Literature

Existing studies on drug-market displacement often focus on immediate suppression effects or city-wide crime trends. Few studies systematically measure how coercive interventions reshape territorial inequality and spatial concentration patterns at fine geographic scales.

Moreover, spatial spillover effects are rarely modeled dynamically using both event-study frameworks and distance-based radial exposure measures.

This project fills this gap by integrating:

- High-resolution hexagonal spatial aggregation
- Causal inference with two-way fixed effects
- Dynamic event-study estimation
- Explicit modeling of spatial inequality (Spatial Gini)
- Radial spillover gradients

This integrated framework allows for a more precise identification of territorial reconfiguration mechanisms than existing displacement studies.

### 9. Institutional and Normative Relevance

Coercive public security interventions in Brazilian metropolitan areas, particularly in São Paulo, have generated recurrent cycles of territorial suppression and reoccupation of open drug-use scenes.

These operations are frequently justified as necessary for restoring urban order, yet their long-term spatial consequences remain insufficiently evaluated.

This project provides a rigorous causal framework to assess:

- Whether coercive strategies reduce territorial concentration
- Whether they generate bounded displacement into adjacent areas
- Whether spatial inequality declines or persists after intervention

Beyond technical evaluation, the project contributes to the normative debate surrounding coercive enforcement by quantifying its territorial effects.

By distinguishing between suppression and spatial reconfiguration, the research supports more evidence-based and socially informed urban security policies.

The methodological framework developed here can guide future evaluations of security interventions across Brazilian metropolitan regions.

### 10. Conceptual Framework: Territorial Compression and Bounded Spillover

This project proposes a conceptual framework in which coercive interventions operate through two simultaneous mechanisms:

1. Territorial Compression:
   Enforcement reduces visible activity in directly treated locations by increasing enforcement intensity and risk.

2. Bounded Spillover:
   Rather than dispersing uniformly across the city, displaced activity relocates within geographically constrained ranges, producing radial decay patterns.

Under this framework, urban illicit markets reorganize spatially in structured ways rather than disappearing.

This model allows differentiation between:
- Genuine suppression
- Local displacement
- Territorial redistribution

By integrating spatial concentration metrics and distance-based causal estimates, the project formalizes a territorial mechanism that advances displacement theory beyond descriptive approaches.

# Postdoctoral Research Proposal
## Territorial Reconfiguration Effects of Coercive Public Security Policies

### 1. Research Problem

Open drug-use scenes represent persistent territorialized phenomena in large metropolitan areas. Coercive public security interventions — such as police operations, intensified patrols, and forced removals — are frequently implemented to suppress these scenes.

However, existing evidence remains inconclusive regarding whether such interventions produce genuine reductions or merely spatial reconfiguration of illicit markets.

This project investigates how coercive security policies reshape the spatial structure, concentration, and mobility of open drug-use scenes.

### 2. Central Research Question

Do coercive public security interventions reduce open drug-use scenes, or do they reconfigure their territorial distribution through bounded spatial displacement?

---

### 3. Theoretical Contribution

This project advances the literature by proposing the **Territorial Reconfiguration Hypothesis**:

Coercive interventions compress visible activity in treated areas but induce spatial redistribution within bounded geographic ranges rather than city-wide dispersion.

The project contributes to:

- Spatial criminology
- Public policy evaluation
- Urban economics of illicit markets
- Displacement theory

It integrates spatial inequality measures and causal identification strategies rarely combined in this literature.

---

### 4. Empirical Strategy

The project combines:

- H3 spatial aggregation (hexagonal grid)
- Difference-in-Differences with Two-Way Fixed Effects
- Event-study dynamic analysis
- Radial spillover models (distance-based treatment intensity)
- Spatial Gini coefficient and concentration metrics

The empirical design allows identification of:

- Local treatment effects
- Dynamic temporal adjustments
- Distance-decay spillovers
- Changes in territorial inequality

---

### 5. Data Strategy

The empirical implementation will rely on:

- Georeferenced police records
- Administrative enforcement data
- Municipal security reports

All public versions of the repository operate on synthetic data to preserve confidentiality and ethical standards.

---

### 6. Expected Contributions

Academic contributions:
- Formal modeling of territorial compression vs displacement
- Integration of spatial inequality into policy evaluation
- Evidence on bounded spillover dynamics

Policy contributions:
- Evidence-based assessment of coercive strategies
- Identification of territorial redistribution risks
- Informing integrated urban security policies

Year 2:
- Spillover and dynamic analysis
- Integration of qualitative interviews
- Manuscript preparation and dissemination

### 8. Gap in the Literature

Existing studies on drug-market displacement often focus on immediate suppression effects or city-wide crime trends. Few studies systematically measure how coercive interventions reshape territorial inequality and spatial concentration patterns at fine geographic scales.

Moreover, spatial spillover effects are rarely modeled dynamically using both event-study frameworks and distance-based radial exposure measures.

This project fills this gap by integrating:

- High-resolution hexagonal spatial aggregation
- Causal inference with two-way fixed effects
- Dynamic event-study estimation
- Explicit modeling of spatial inequality (Spatial Gini)
- Radial spillover gradients

This integrated framework allows for a more precise identification of territorial reconfiguration mechanisms than existing displacement studies.

### 9. Institutional and Normative Relevance

Coercive public security interventions in Brazilian metropolitan areas, particularly in São Paulo, have generated recurrent cycles of territorial suppression and reoccupation of open drug-use scenes.

These operations are frequently justified as necessary for restoring urban order, yet their long-term spatial consequences remain insufficiently evaluated.

This project provides a rigorous causal framework to assess:

- Whether coercive strategies reduce territorial concentration
- Whether they generate bounded displacement into adjacent areas
- Whether spatial inequality declines or persists after intervention

Beyond technical evaluation, the project contributes to the normative debate surrounding coercive enforcement by quantifying its territorial effects.

By distinguishing between suppression and spatial reconfiguration, the research supports more evidence-based and socially informed urban security policies.

The methodological framework developed here can guide future evaluations of security interventions across Brazilian metropolitan regions.

### 10. Conceptual Framework: Territorial Compression and Bounded Spillover

This project proposes a conceptual framework in which coercive interventions operate through two simultaneous mechanisms:

1. Territorial Compression:
   Enforcement reduces visible activity in directly treated locations by increasing enforcement intensity and risk.

2. Bounded Spillover:
   Rather than dispersing uniformly across the city, displaced activity relocates within geographically constrained ranges, producing radial decay patterns.

Under this framework, urban illicit markets reorganize spatially in structured ways rather than disappearing.

This model allows differentiation between:
- Genuine suppression
- Local displacement
- Territorial redistribution

By integrating spatial concentration metrics and distance-based causal estimates, the project formalizes a territorial mechanism that advances displacement theory beyond descriptive approaches.

---

### 11. International Research Positioning

The project directly engages with international debates in spatial criminology, urban economics, and public policy evaluation.

Globally, research on crime displacement has produced mixed evidence regarding whether enforcement leads to diffusion of benefits, spatial displacement, or crime relocation. However, much of this literature relies on coarse geographic units or aggregate crime measures, limiting the ability to detect fine-grained territorial reorganization.

By integrating high-resolution hexagonal spatial grids with dynamic difference-in-differences and radial spillover modeling, this project contributes a more precise identification strategy for territorial market responses.

The framework is particularly relevant for large metropolitan areas characterized by spatial inequality and concentrated informal economies — contexts found not only in Brazil, but also in Latin America, parts of Europe, and North American cities experiencing visible street-level drug markets.

The proposed Territorial Compression and Bounded Spillover model advances displacement theory by formally modeling spatial inequality and bounded reconfiguration rather than assuming binary suppression versus displacement outcomes.

This approach positions the project for publication in international journals focused on:

- Urban studies
- Criminology
- Applied econometrics
- Public policy analysis

---

### 12. Expected Scientific Outputs

The project is structured to generate at least three international journal articles:

Article 1:
Causal impact of coercive enforcement on territorial concentration of open drug-use scenes.

Article 2:
Dynamic event-study evidence on bounded spatial spillovers in urban illicit markets.

Article 3:
Spatial inequality and territorial reconfiguration following security interventions.

Target outlets include journals in:
- Urban Studies
- Criminology
- Journal of Quantitative Criminology
- Journal of Urban Economics (applied section)
- Public Policy and Administration

The integrated spatial-econometric framework also provides a methodological contribution that can be adapted to other policy domains.

### 13. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

Risk 1: Data Access Constraints  
Georeferenced enforcement and police data may face administrative or confidentiality restrictions.

Mitigation:
The project is structured to operate with aggregated spatial grids (H3), preserving anonymity. Synthetic simulations are already implemented to validate the full analytical pipeline prior to restricted data access.

Risk 2: Identification Challenges  
Parallel trends assumptions may not hold in all treated locations.

Mitigation:
Dynamic event-study models are used to test pre-treatment trends explicitly. Sensitivity analyses and alternative treatment definitions (e.g., varying treatment intensity thresholds) will be implemented.

Risk 3: Measurement Error in Spatial Spillovers  
Spillover effects may be sensitive to buffer definitions.

Mitigation:
The project estimates multiple radial bands and conducts robustness checks with alternative distance cutoffs and continuous distance measures.

Risk 4: Policy Heterogeneity  
Coercive interventions may vary in intensity across time and space.

Mitigation:
The framework allows modeling heterogeneous treatment intensity and incorporating enforcement dosage measures where available.

By anticipating these challenges, the project maintains methodological rigor and adaptability under real-world institutional constraints.
